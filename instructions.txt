Instructions for Setting Up the Virtual Environment and Dependencies

1. Create a Virtual Environment:
   - Open your terminal/command prompt
   - Navigate to the project directory
   - Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
     ```
     python -m venv env
     ```

2. Activate the Virtual Environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install Required Dependencies:
   - Make sure you're in the project directory and the virtual environment is activated
   - Run the following command to install all required packages:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

4. Verify Installation:
   - After installation is complete, you can verify the installed packages by running:
     ```
     pip list
     ```

5. Running the Application:
   - With the virtual environment activated, run:
     ```
     python run.py
     ```

Note: Make sure you have Python installed on your system before following these steps.
The virtual environment (env folder) should not be included in version control as it contains system-specific files.
